Each directory within this is a root for python. so consider creating a virtual environment there.

For eg: within directory __costanalysis__ 

Linux:
```
>>> python -m venv env
>>> env/bin/actiavte
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows:
```
>>> python -m venv env
>>> env\Scripts\actiavte
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
